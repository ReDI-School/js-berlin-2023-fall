Exercise 1

Forbidden Word

Given a word and an array of words, print out to the console, 
whether the word appears or does not appear in the array of words

such as:
word <- "rock"
words <- ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
// rock appears in the words array

word <- "wonderful"
words <- ["sad", "gloomy", "blue"]
// wonderful does not appear in the words array

hint: you know how to access each element of the array using an index,
when you try to access an element with an index value larger than the highest index, 
then you get an undefined. Use that knowledge to your advantage.

words[2] gives "blue". If you try words[3] it will give undefined
